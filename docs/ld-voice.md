# The Learning Hub Voice

​​​​In order to create a cohesive and consistent message, all website content should adhere to the Learning Hubvoice at all times. Messages should be smart yet approachable. We know our stuff, but we don’t talk over everyone. We keep it simple and understandable. The Learning Hub voice is witty yet classy. We have a sense of humor, and don’t mind poking fun at ourselves, but we always act our age. We are bold yet proven. We have been there and done that. But not everyone knows. So we don’t just brag about what we can do; we prove it by letting our stories speak for us​. With these words in mind, write content that is natural and flowing. Grammar and punctuation should adhere to the journalistic AP style.​​​​

## Content Style

Content within the Learning Hub can be viewed on desktop computers, tablets, smartphones, televisions, and just about everything in between. Keep this in mind when creating your own content, and be sure to test all new content before publishing. Testing your content for mobile screen sizes can be as easy as resizing your browser window. When previewing your changes, shrink the size of your window so that it looks more like a tablet or a smartphone. If you don’t see any major problems, your content will likely work just fine on mobile devices.

In general, the best way to optimize your content for smaller screens it to keep it simple. Create paragraphs, headings, lists, add images, and utilize the styles we’ve built into the SharePoint rich text editor. Don’t try to edit the HTML behind the scenes, and avoid third-party add-ins like scripts or plugins that may alter your content. Keep it simple, and you’ll find that authoring content within the Learning Hub is easy as pie.​​​

## Copy and Paste

In general, any content that you copy and paste into the SharePoint editor will retain the style of the source from which it was copied. This can create issues with style consistency, and can even lead to errors or issues with the page rendering on mobile devices. If you find that your pasted content is not appearing as intended, you can paste content instead as plain text, which removes all style from the copied content. You may also clean the formatting from any existing content within the editor by using the Clear Format button in the SharePoint ribon (keyboard shortcut: Control+Space).

## Dates, Times, and Numbers

In general, content should adhere to the journalistic AP stylebook. When referring to numbers, currencies, dates, and times, please adhere to the following guidelines.

- Always spell nu​mbers one through nine
- Use numerals for numbers 10 and higher
- Use commas to separate every thousandth (1,000,000)
- Use numerals when a number relates to a unit of measure (5%, page 5, 5 feet, \$5.00)
- For times, always use a 12-hour time format, no leading zeroes, and include a - space followed by the lowercase a.m./p.m. designation (10:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m.)
- Dates should be written in the following format: June 3, 2014
- Shorthand dates may be written as: Jun 3 or 6/3/2014
- Dates should never be written as ordinals (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)

## Headings

Headings are succinct messages that describe content that follows the heading. Use headings to break up your content pages into logical sections that make it easy for readers to quickly scan the page for what they’re looking for. Note that all headings should be entered in sentence case.

Headings are divided into levels, starting with heading level one, followed by heading level two, etcetera. This continues all the way down to heading level six. Headings should be ranked by importance, with level one headings being the most important, and level six headings being the least important.

## Lists

Creating a bulleted list is easy. Simply click on the Bullets button in the SharePoint ribbon.

- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet​
- Consectetur adipiscing elit
- Nam auctor ex et erat ullamcorper, auctor eleifend erat aliquam
- Etiam maximus mi vitae commodo pulvinar

When sequential order seems relevant, a numbered list is just as easy.​ Use the Numbering button to create a numbered list.

1. Sed vel rhoncus quam, eu egestas m​auris
1. Etiam velit arcu, feugiat vel lorem a, auctor dictum tortor
1. Praesent non elit eu enim tincidunt auctor sed id velit
1. Nullam lacinia dictum tellus, a aliquet ipsum auctor a

## Button Rows

Add a stylized button or call-to-action to your content using the Button Row styles in the SharePoint ribbon.

- Button Row Primary
- Button Row Success
- Button Row Info
- Button Row Warning
- Button Row Danger

## Image Renditions

Utilize Image Renditions when working with images on Learning Hub pages. Image renditions are pre-defined thumbnail sizes that are atuomatically created for every image that is uploaded to the Learning Hub. This makes it easy to ​​upload a high-quality photo and quickly add a smaller, cropped, and optimized version of that photo to any page.

Click on the Image tab of the SharePoint ribbon while an image is selected, and use the Pick Renditions menu to choose a rendition.​​​

Additionally, you can adjust the cropping of any image rendition by choosing Edit Renditions from the Pick Renditions menu.​

- News Image: 900px x 455px
